/**
 * A resource that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic to a Linode
 * service. Only one Firewall can be attached to a Linode at any given time. Create a
 * Firewall Device to assign a Firewall to a Linode service. Currently, Firewalls can
 * only be assigned to Linode instances.
 *
 * @property int                                $id      The Firewall's unique ID.
 * @property string                             $label   The Firewall's label, for display purposes only.
 *                                                       Firewall labels have the following constraints:

 *                                                       * May only consist of alphanumeric characters, dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`)
 *                                                       or periods (`.`).
 *                                                       * Cannot have two dashes (`--`), underscores (`__`) or periods (`..`) in a row.
 *                                                       * Must be between 3 and 32 characters.
 *                                                       * Must be unique.
 * @property string                             $status  The status of this Firewall.
 *                                                       * When a Firewall is first created its status is `enabled`.
 *                                                       * Use the Update Firewall endpoint to set a Firewall's status to `enabled` or
 *                                                       `disabled`.
 *                                                       * Use the Delete Firewall endpoint to delete a Firewall.
 * @property string                             $created When this Firewall was created.
 * @property string                             $updated When this Firewall was last updated.
 * @property FirewallRules                      $rules   The inbound and outbound access rules to apply to the Firewall.
 *                                                       A Firewall may have up to 25 rules across its inbound and outbound rulesets.
 * @property string[]                           $tags    An array of tags applied to this object. Tags are for organizational purposes
 *                                                       only.
 * @property FirewallDevicesRepositoryInterface $devices Firewall devices.
